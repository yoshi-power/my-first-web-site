<p>The Fraunhofer WKI specializes in bio-based 
    chemical products and materials, production 
    technology, functional integration, lightweight
     construction, material and product testing, recycling 
     processes and indoor air quality. Almost all processes,
      materials and products resulting from our research 
      activities are used industrially. We operate worl
      dwide and work project-related with research ins
      titutions and industrial partners, e. g. with comp
      anies from the wood and furniture industries, the co
      nstruction industry, the chemical industry, the packag
      ing industry and the automotive industry. Our particular
       strength is our holistic research approach. We develop ma
       terials and technologies for a bio-based, resource-conservin
        and climate-friendly economic cycle - from raw materials to d
        evelopment and quality assurance to recycling.</p>
